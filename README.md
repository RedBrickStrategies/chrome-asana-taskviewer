This app is an offline task viewer for Asana (http://asana.com). Experience the native Asana experience from your desktop. It shows you the tasks including their details, allows you to mark them complete and comment + upload files to them. You can configure the workspace, project and do some basic filters and sorting. The app caches the tasks offline and also notifies you of changed tasks using the Chrome Notifications. You can now also add tasks to your projects.

The main advantage of using this app is speed. With the global keyboard shortcut which can show / hide this app at any time + the ability to quickly switch between different projects and workspaces and view tasks offline, this is a must have solution for all Asana power users.

The app has several additional configuration options including flexible resizing window, stay on top and disabling the auto update mode.
